# WeddingVenueBrowser
A website that displays information about wedding venues that are stored in an external database.

This project was coursework at Loughborough University, and I recieved a first (90%) for it.

The user can view all venues available on the website and also filter their search according to date, catering grades, and minimum and maximum capacity and cost.

The user can also get more information about a venue by clicking on it. They can see capacity, location, average popularity per month, and additional photos.
